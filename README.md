Index html - including arranging stories by date posted, search option, login / logout functionality, css styling (hover effects, font style change, hover effect, background colours etc.) (nb. I intentionally commented out the author from the storycard info on the home page as I preferred just the name and date posted.)

Story html - css styling and added ‘Posted by’

Createstory html - Changed wording for inputs and css changes made in main css to keep look consistent with other pages. Added option to add image when creating story with default image if URL not supplied.

Admin Page screenshot provided to show that I added News database into admin so I could add, delete and edit stories.

I really enjoyed this unit and would have loved more time to play with Django, get all the features completed and spend more time with css styling (it was great to practice that again). I did what I could in the time I had available but definitely want to do more.
